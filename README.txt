Do not open the "home.js" or "main.css" files or delete them, those files are required for the program to run.
All you need to do to run the program, is extract the folder, then open the "RoTool.html" file. Once it is 
opened, there will be multiple links displaying randomly generated Roblox players, groups and avatar packages.
New links are generated every 15 seconds.
